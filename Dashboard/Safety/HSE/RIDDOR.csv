Several slabs had already been safely transferred & stowed on the trailer.For the sixth slab:This had been safely placed on the trailer and the lifting grab released by the assistant . At this point , the assistant lost his footing and in doing so , noticed that the top edge of the slab was moving towards him ( instead of away from him , to rest against the slabs already placed ) . Realising that he could not steady the slab , the assistant jumped backwards , landing on his back on the ground , bumping his head . The slab fell , causing it to break up . It seems that a piece of the broken slab struck the assistant’s leg , causing the broken leg . The injured person was taken to hospital by private car and treated for a fractured leg. MEASURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF INCIDENTReview existing risk assessment & safe system of work for this process , and incorporate the following controls :Either :a Introduced a mechanical stop/restraint on the trailer/A-frames , to prevent the slab from moving significantly away from its intended resting position . ORb.Introduce a 2nd person , to assist in guiding the slab(s) on the ‘A-frame, as the grab is released.",07-05-14

762,Male,55-59,M&E Installation,Bone fracture,Trunk,Major/Specified,Area B,Fall from open edge,"Company tradesmen are carrying out some dilapidation repairs on a clients premises.A small area of glazed canopy and fire escape walkway had been removed and was being replaced by a timber flat roof with a fibre glass covering to it.This was effectively in a rear passage way behind the shop.The size of this roof was approximately 1.3 x 4.0 m and the roof deck height was 3 m. During the installation of the roof boarding , The foreman joiner was working on the roof deck . The second joiner , who was effectively working at ground floor level was waiting to be given the size to cut the final roof board .It appears that the second joiner had climbed up a pair of steps ( not the access to the roof ) , for reasons still not fully known , pending getting this.It is thought that he may have done this just to observe what was being done or to get in a better position to hear the sizes being shouted to him.The area where the steps had been placed wasnt particularly level.It is thought , at this time , that the steps have started to go over , probably because the floor wasnt level and the joiner has then grabbed hold of a brickwork paraphet in front of him to steady himself and the immediate area of brickwork has come away .The joiner has then fallen to the floor with the brickwork falling onto a low level wall adjacent to him , breaking the fall , and then coming to rest at ground level bending the steps that had toppled over. Both ladders and tower scaffold were provided to carry out the works by the company to carry out the work however due to the width restriction to the passageway the tower sent couldnt be used.The ladder was used initially but due to the restricted nature of the work the operatives decided to use their steps. Unfortunately the steps involved with the incident were n't actually being used as access or a working platform. For the main element of the works a narrower tower should have been utilised and ladders used for access to the roof instead of the steps.There doesnt appear to be any reason at this time for the joiner to be up the steps he was on .",07-09-16

After 12 packs were unloaded [NAME] dismounted from the hiab and moved the wagon forward approximately 3 to 4 metres to create more space to the rear of the wagon .

[Name] has no recollection of what happened immediately before or after the accident but he confirmed that he was lifting the load over the heras fencing and 100mm blocks .The operator’s lack of experience in not realising that the wagon’s lateral stability was reduced , coupled with a perception that the heras fencing and blocks to the left of the wagon were an obstacle to avoid , may have affected his usual method of operation.

The two employees had just arrived at the site and they were setting up ready to undertake the work required. The IP set up the tar pitcher, and lit the gas . The pitcher already contained some bitumen from a previous job and the gas started to heat that residue bitumen. At this point [NAME] had moved away from the van and was undertaking another task . After approximately 5 minutes IP opened a tub of solid bitumen, which was already slightly soft in texture and moved it towards the pitcher . IP at this point had chosen not to wear any of the PPE provided , and on further investigation had not taken any to the site in the company vehicle. IP stated that even if the PPE had been in the van he would have not worn it, as he never believed that he would not be harmed and had become complacent. IP then held the whole block of bitumen above the pitcher, thinking mistakenly that the residue bitumen in the pitcher had yet to turn to liquid. However the bitumen had melted but there was crust on the top and this led IP to believe it was still solid. At this point the bitumen slipped out of IP's hands and fell into the pitcher causing the residue bitumen to splash back and cover certain areas of IP's body . At first IP did n’t realise the severity of the situation and when he saw a farmer passing by he hid by the side of the van so that he could n’t be seen .

1731,Male,Unknown,Installation of formwork,Concussion and/or internal injuries,Head,Major/Specified,Area E,Slip or trip on same level,"Whilst installing a king post which is a 12mtr long x 260mm x 260mm steel H section beam into the pre augered hole in the ground , attached by a snatch chain to a 25 ton excavator , both tested and certified under LOLER 98 , was lowered into the hole and was being placed into its position . The post required to be vertically plumb was being levered using a timber prop . <NAME> <NAME> who was keeping the beam in position until the packings were in place , slipped causing the lever to jump up , which caught him on the side of his head and he collapsed onto the floor at which point he passed out.Environmental conditions were dry and firm level ground.Immediate cause : <NAME> <NAME> who was keeping the beam in position until the packings were in place , slipped causing the lever to jump up , which caught him on the side of his head and he collapsed onto the floor at which point he passed out . Underlying cause : Due to underground obstructions it was not possible for the rig to drill a vertical hole , resulting in the deflection of the post and requiring the additional levering of the post into a plumb position.Root Cause : The design solution employed was based on the Site Investigation Report, which was inadequate and did not fully identify underground obstructions.The kingpost solution was decided upon based upon the findings of the Site Investigation Report however , following a reduced level dig it was found that the ground was not as expected , with boulders causing complications with the drilling operations . These unexpected complications resulted in changes to the proposed methods of construction and <NAME> should have ceased operations and paid due diligence to other options rather than amending the existing method of construction.The complications mean't that the post was not inserted vertically plumb and as a result an inappropriate method of work and equipment was adopted to plumb the king post . By using the timber prop <NAME> <NAME> was put at risk as it should have been foreseeable that if the timber or himself had slipped or the post moved then the lever would slip and possibly cause an injury , which is what has happened . Actions taken :Pay due diligence to site investigation reports and consider all alternative proposals in selecting appropriate solutions at the design stage .Ensure that suitable equipment is available and utilised.Assess all changes to the method of work and the associated foreseeable risk . A delay in reporting from site to head office ( IT problems on site ) resulted in delay in notification .",06-03-12

In order to obtain the material , he had to descend the scaffolding to reach the stock pile on the ground . When descending the scaffolding , instead of using the appointed proprietary stairs which had been installed , the operative used the emergency escape ladder as this was a more direct route . On descending the emergency escape ladder , the saw that the operative was carrying caught on the scaffold , this caused the operative to lose his balance and his foot slipped out of the rung of the ladder and he fell the remainder of the distance to the scaffold platform below.The operative complained of having hurt his back and was attended to by one of the sites appointed first-aiders , however no treatment was appropriate and he was advised to seek further medical attention . The operative later reported that he had been attended to at hospital and had bruising to his back , no other injuries have been reported . The operative has now been absent from work for a period of more than seven days and at present is still absent. On investigation , no issues could be identified with the ladder that the operative used and the conditions at the time would not suggest that the rungs of the ladder or the operatives boots were slippery with water or mud . It is believed that the operative failed to maintain three points of contact on the ladder due to him carrying a saw in his hand which he intended to use to cut a piece of timber.All operatives on site have been reminded that the ladders on the scaffold are for emergency escape purposes only and that the proprietary stairs are to be used for access and egress on scaffolding . Operatives have also been briefed on the safe use of ladders with particular focus on maintaining three points of contact at all times and not to carry any tools , equipment or materials whilst using ladders .",01-08-16

The platform was being moved from level 1 to the ground floor in preparation for being off-hired. According to [NAME] , a witness to the event , the telehandler driver was attempting to lift the platform over the top of the edge protection guard-rail , and was not lifting the platform by utilising the purpose made “fork slot ” lifting points , but rather the forks were inserted beneath the platform.The telehandler and driver were supplied by the principal contractor  [NAME] who are responsible for vertical movement of materials around site , in this case from level one to ground.The allocation of lifting work to the telehandler was by an ad-hoc process instigated by the work teams themselves . The  [NAME] site supervisor was allegedly consulted , and gave his permission to undertake the lift . The driver had opted to undertake the lift by lowering his forks over the top of the guard-rail onto the first floor slab . From his cab the driver would not have been able to see the forks or how the platform was being loaded onto the forks . However the [NAME] operatives were assisting the telehandler driver from the level 1 slab , acting as Banksmen/ loader.

The work was controlled under prepared RAMS and under the direct supervision. The work area was in good condition although the floor surface was wet due to ingress of rain. The floor surface was linoleum covered timber floor. Housekeeping was good and maintained throughout.  <NAME>(Injured Person) was carrying out pre-demolition soft-stripping activities. This required using 1 metre crow bar to remove fixed door frames. The IP had successfully removed several door frames previously. The IP appears to have initially removed the architrave and then proceeded to remove the upright of the doorframe. The IP appears to have inserted crowbar to the centre of the upright door frame and pulled the crowbar towards him  with maximum body weight  leaning back. The effect of this resulted in the timber splitting rather than removing the doorframe complete. As the IP pulled / leaned back the crowbar the IP appears have had his feet close together  not a stable stance. The effort of pulling suddenly overcame the resistance between the soles of the work boots and wet linoleum. The IP was unable to correct his balance / stance and fell to his side and right leg twisted  resulting in dislocation of the knee. A Colleague telephoned the Site Supervisor who attended the IP. The Emergency Services were called at (13:59) but declined to attend due to low severity of injuries described. The Site Supervisor assisted IP to hospital at <NAME>  Casualty Dept.

The temporary gas bottle compound was a Heras fenced compound 3 to 4 metres away from the made up ground on a grassy area. The grassy area had become slippy due to rain. This was the first rainy night since the project started. The Heras fence of the compound was opened. It was pushed back and left slightly ajar. The empty gas bottle was lifted off the trolley by the two operatives. As one of the two fitters walked backwards with the load he slipped and fell. This incident occurred on the night shift at approximately 01:30 am The fitter had apparently dislocated his left shoulder. The fitter initially self diagnosed the injury as he has a pre existing condition and he has dislocated his shoulder on several occasions before (not work related). The ambulance was called through the agreed first aid procedure. The attending paramedic put the shoulder back into position and after a suitable rest period and following a post incident briefing and discussion with the fitter (where he expressed his desire and suitability to return to work) he was allowed to return to his normal duties. He has not reported any further effects as a result of this incident. All [Name] site operatives have undergone a mill H&S induction, a CDM H&S induction and must possess a current CCNSG safety passport. The temporary gas bottle compound has now been relocated onto the hard standing ground. A revised risk assessment of the compound area has been undertaken. The location, timing and appartantly minor effect of the incident on the injured person contibuted to this injury not being reported until today (after the weekend). This was the earliest opportunity to gather and collate the information needed for this report.

The IP was kept in hospital until the afternoon of <NAME> <NAME> .On the day of the accident the <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> briefed IP to get panels ready to go out for a customer . The procedure to get the panels ready is for the operatives to place the panels on beams to wash down and then buff using a buffing machine to remove excess concrete from the side of the panels . To use the buff machine an extension cable and an 110V 5KVA transformer is used and plugged into an outside portacabin . On the day of the incident weather conditions were poor it had been raining all day . Therefore , the IP took his gloves off , as they were wet . He then leant down to plug the extension cable into the transformer and when he received the shock and started to shake . As the IP lifted up the flap on the transformer he received a shock . ( He did not plug in the extension cable ; he received the shock before it was inserted ) . He had the cable in the right hand and lifted the flap with his left .

A first response vehicle turned up within a couple of minutes , quickly followed by two policemen and an ambulance . The ambulance took over from the paramedic treating the IP. The police interviewed the site manager and stated no follow up action would be needed . We believe that as the IP bent down to plug the extension cable into a transformer with him being wet ( witness statements ) there has been an arc event . The likeliest root cause at this time is water running off <NAME> jacket ( waterproof hi visability coat ) and entering into one of the outlets and causing an arc . People usually tip the transfer on a 45-degree angle so as to gain better access to the outlet.The cabin and electrical equipment were isolated immediately . The fixed electrical installation for the portacabin and the electrical test on the transformer were checked and found to be in date and certification available however , we got all equipment re tested independently as a precaution and all was found to be satisfactory .

A ready mix concrete lorry arrived at the position where the concrete was required . The IP approached the stationary vehicle and pulled down the extension delivery chute at the rear of the vehicle with his left hand . He was standing on the off-side of the vehicle . His right hand touched the mid part of the chute on the bottom , which is a mechanical joint . His right index finger was trapped by the unfolding chute and as the chute bounced when it reached its full extension , the finger tip was released . The IP realised he had been trapped but was not in pain . He took off his glove and realised he had a cut to his finger and reported this to his site supervisor who sent him for first aid and arranged for another operative to take the IP to hospital as a precautionary measure . The IP reported his injury to the [NAME] site manager as a cut finger , a plaster was put on his finger tip ,and he was then taken to the nearest A&E . His finger was x-rayed and strapped and bandaged . He wa sent home and a appointment made for the following morning at a different hospital department . There he was booked in for an operation the following Monday . His finger tip was found to be fractured : the operation involved removal of his finger nail to allow the resetting of the bone and subsequent stitching back of the skin at the end of his finger . he was given penicillin , but had an allergic reaction to this . Site was unaware of the treatment received and understood the injury to be simply a cut finger . The ready mix lorry had the following signs on the rear : "" This equipment only to be operated by [NAME] trained personnel . "" "" Wet concrete burns , authorised operator only . "" "" Keep clear of vehicle , only driver is authorised to operate controls . "" Despite this the risk of entrapment in the chute was not understood . The risk has now been communicated across the Company with a specific instruction not to touch the delivery chute . The newest ready mix lorries have a hydraulicaaly operated extending chute which does not require any manual operation to extend - the warning notices relating to this now state an exclusion zone of 6.0m . is required as the chute can extend to 4.5 m . remotely operated by the driver . This has now been communicated across the Company as the practice until now has been to stand close to the delivery chute and indeed guide it in placing concrete.The reason for late reporting was that the extent of the treatment was not understood at site level and when the IP did not return to work , the at work injury was not thought to be the reason for absence . Our reporting and recording procedures have been reviewed and changed to ensure this does not recur and all sites have been made aware of the necessity of recording all accidents to allow investigation as early as possible and reporting if required in a timely fashion .",02-04-14

586,Male,35-44,Concreting,Fracture,Lower limb,Major/Specified,Area D,Struck by flying object,"Sub contractors were employed to install underground duct work that forms part of the infrastructure for a new solar farm. It is alleged that the injured person was installing a 160mm duct line and in doing so the draw cord jammed inside the duct. To assist in freeing the draw cord , the injured person and a colleague tied the end of the draw cord to the bucket of a mechanical excavator to attempt to release a jam. The contractors had tied a pneumatic hammer tool ( acting as a draw weight ) to the opposite end of the draw cord as an aid to feeding the draw cord into the duct lengths. During this activity the draw cord then became unattached from the excavator bucket and recoiled back into the duct , due to the tension . The draw cord pulled the pneumatic hammer tool back towards the duct at speed and the injured person was struck on the lower right leg just above the ankle. The first aider was in attendance and called for assistance, due to the remoteness of the site the air ambulance was in attendance and the injured person was taken to hospital .Following the accident a full investigation was conducted and immediate control measures implemented to prevent a reoccurrence.

He required the whacker plate to compact the material he had just laid . He approached the telescopic fork lift driver and asked if he would bring the whacker plate to the pavement with the fork lift . The forklift driver said he would do it in a couple of minutes as he had to move a partial pallet of lock block first . The forks were set too wide for the pallet of lock block and it appears the fork lift driver asked the IP to move the forks so they would fit the pallet . The IP agreed to move the forks to help out as he has done so throughout his career . The forks were positioned in such a way that the fork had to be lifted clear of the carriage before it can be repositioned . He lifted the fork with his right hand and placed his left hand at the heel of the fork and was pulling at the fork to move it . As he was pulling the fork it slipped from his right hand and the fork fell back against its resting place on the carriage trapping his left hand between the fork and the carriage causing a fracture of the metacarpal bone on the ring finger . He attended hospital and underwent surgery where a steel plate was attached to the fractured bone to hold it in place . The IP is very experienced and has re-positioned fork lift forks several times . The forks were left parallel with the ground while being moved . They should have been tilted forward until the heel of the fork came away from the carriage preventing the need to lift the fork to move it . Work procedures and risk assessments are being reviewed .

1157,Male,25-34,Fixing Reinforcement,Fracture,Finger or fingers,Over-3/7-Day,Area B,Using hand/power tools,Exploratory holes were being advanced using hand held window sampling equipment.  The incident occurred whilst extracting the window sampler barrel and rods from a exploratory hole using a hydraulically powered ram set.  Note due to the depth reached within the exploratory hole this was the first time the ram set had been used.Whilst extracting the window sampler barrel the drill rods are split and unscrewed during the extraction process. Whilst extracting the rods from the borehole the operator went to split a joint between two of the drill rods using a set of stilsons at the base of the ram set.  Whilst trying to undo the thread the drill rods slipped through the roller block at the top of the ram set which was holding the drill rods.  This resulted the operators thumb on his left hand getting temporarily trapped between the side of the ram set and the drill rods / top of the window sampler barrel towards the lower section of the ram set.After the event it was noted that only one of the two roller blocks provided with the ram set were being used.  This was due to the second set not being able to be positioned correctly within the lower part of the ram set due to the position and length of the hydraulic hose at the base of the ram unit.  This second set also assists with holding and extracting the drill rods.The second set of roller blocks had previously been identified as an improvement by the operators and had been ordered and provided to the drill crew to ensure the ram set could be used safely.  Following the incident it became apparent that the lower roller block set could not be used as the lower hydraulic hose between the two rams prevent them from being positioned correctly.Actions following the event include refresher training for all operaitves who use the hand held window sampler and associated equipment and checking all ram sets to ensure the lower set of roller blocks can be inserted and operate correctly.,01-09-16

Immediately prior to this the operative put a new blade on his stanley knife in preparation for the activity . The operative is right handed and inserted the stanley knife blade into the 1000 gauge polythene sheeting , he started to cut from right to left , his left hand was holding the framework of the enclosure . Due to the sharpness of the brand new blade the physical effort was excessive and as such the blade travelled extremely rapidly from right to left . Consequently the blade of the stanley knife struck the operatives left hand which due to the circumstances was held quite rigidly . The blade therefore penetrated the skin and took a slither right underneath the skin creating a crescent shaped injury across the topside of the left hand.The health & safety manager has instructed an external consultant to fully investigate the incident and make appropriate recommendations . The final report as yet is not complete and will follow shortly , however , initially the following actions are considered to be likely recommendations  1 ) Review of relevant aspects of existing risk assessment , policy and procedure . 2 ) The workforce will be engaged around the use of alternative hand tools such as scissors , safety knives , or other available safety cutting devices . 3 ) The possibility of using more effective PPE will be considered , once all actions are determined all site teams including contract Managers and site Supervisors will be aggressively briefed ( [Name] ) as regards new procedures , equipment and techniques etc .

328,Male,45-54,Installation of formwork,Lacerations and open wounds,Lower limb,Over-3/7-Day,Area B,Machinery guarding,"The IP was working on a mobile drill rig  (Commachio GEO305) , drilling boreholes as part as a site investigation to provide geotechnical data . As the IP was trying to remove the sample shoe from a 113mm dynamic sample barrel on completion of a sample run using a Pioneer 2 Drill . The sample barrel was placed on the drill string trestles and secured just in front of the barrel’s shoe with a set of long handled chain wrenches . The IP used an adjustable pipe wrench to loosen the shoe , however the thread was stuck fast . As he applied additional pressure to the front of the barrel using his bodyweight , the opposite , furthest end of the barrel lifted up and moved off to the side of the front trestle . As the barrel was still attached to the drill’s winch this caused a seesaw effect , lifting the front of the barrel over the arc of the chain wrench onto the IP’s leg . As the barrel fell it struck the IP’s right leg in the area of his calf and slid down his outer leg hitting his ankle . The IP tried to move out of the way but then struck his leg against a large angular bridge stone ( that was laying on the floor close to his work area ) as the barrel made contact with him . The additional pressure applied to the front of the barrel caused the opposite/furthest end of the barrel to lifted up and move off to the side of the front trestle . As the barrel was still attached to the drill’s winch this caused a seesaw effect , lifting the front of the barrel over the arc of the chain wrench onto the IP’s leg . 1 . The barrel should be secured mid-body with a chain wrench and not to the base of the barrel . This contributed to the top of the barrel lifting and dropping to the side of the front trestle . 2. The area around the thread had not been tapped prior to breaking the fast joint . This could have reduced the amount of addition pressure being applied to the shoe .3 . When the sample barrel shoe is overly fast , the co-worker should assist to counterbalance the barrel , to ensure it remains secure on the trestles .4 . The lip at the end of the trestle was insufficient to retaining the sample barrel as it lifted when the IP applied additional pressure to the sample barrel shoe . SOP for Making Up and Emptying Samples Barrells was reviewed , amended and re-issued to all drilling staff.Trestle ends redesigned to retain sample barrels should they lift whilst breaking the shoe from barrel .",01-09-15
